/*
Algorithm:
1. translate M2 GB into the 0,1 levels of the frame
2. construct the rest of the frame
  this entails:
    a. compute ideal quotient
    b. sort these (in Schreyer order)
    c. resort all of them at this new level, by degree.
    d. make sure that we know which monomials are "above" a given one (DescendentRange: but now
       they are all over the place)
  all of the above information can be in a memory arena.   This will last the lifetime of
  the computation.
3. For each (level,degree):
  create memory blocks (perhaps arenas?)
  create the coefficient matrix
    need hash table for the columns
    really, have two matrices (or, set of rows, same columnset): reducers, spairs
    (remember: we ignore all columns which are not in the initial submodule).
  reduce matrix
    when reducing an spair row: keep track of the reduction row process.
    after that, translate this to a polynomial in the frame
4. betti numbers
  create matrix (over coeff ring) of (level,deg) --> (level-1,deg).
  compute its rank
  create a Betti display for this
5. Minimalization of the matrices
  to be determined: how best to do this
