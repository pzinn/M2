   - Frank needs to read the guts of the program
   - Need to describe the local coordiantes and 
   - Give a proof of correctness
   - Conclusion
   - Can state that the PHC version computes certain *big* examples

* Decent library of examples, for both Macaulay2 and Phc Pack
   - Run all problems in G(3,7), G(3,8), and G(4,8)

* Write Software for Macaulay2 paper

* Test repopulating the fiber

* Documentation

* Need parameter homotopy for user defined flags
