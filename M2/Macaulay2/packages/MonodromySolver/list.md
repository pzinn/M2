1) seed checking

2) better recording of failures (how many/of which type)

3) passing "track" options to solver
   *) possibility of a global option table?

4) multidegrees of solution variety, automatic trace test

5) "SelectEdgeAndDirection" is kind of irritating---good way to replace?

6) option of user-defined equality for solution points (could be very helpful if there's symmetry)

*) computing monodromy group

*) homotopy when coefficients are nonlinear in parameters? (not sure how feasible)

*) "safe modes"
  *) checking residuals after tracking
  *) automatic refinement
  *) "certified mode"?

*) tidy up documentation

*) tidy up code
