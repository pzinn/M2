        info about how to construct explicit Mackey functors
    Description
        Text
            {\bf The general constructor:} New Mackey functors can be built using @TO "makeCpMackeyFunctor"@, which constructs a Mackey functor out of a restriction, transfer, and conjugation @TO "matrix"@, in that order. It takes as input a prime, and three matrices. For example, we can construct $\mathbb{F}_4$ as a $C_2$-Galois Mackey functor as follows:

        Example
            U:=cokernel(matrix({{2,0},{0,2}}));
            C:=inducedMap(U,U,matrix({{1,1},{0,1}}));
            F:=kernel(C - id_U);
            R:=inducedMap(U,F,matrix({{1,0},{0,1}}));
            T:=inducedMap(F,U,matrix({{0,1},{0,0}}));
            M:=makeCpMackeyFunctor(2,R,T,C)

        Text
            The output of the @TO("makeCpMackeyFunctor")@ method is a @TO("CpMackeyFunctor")@, which is a new @TO2(Type,"type")@ implemented in this package. Under the hood it is a @TO2("Macaulay2Doc :: hash tables","hash table")@, encoding all the data of the Mackey functor. The underlying and fixed modules can be recovered with the @TO("getUnderlyingModule")@ and @TO("getFixedModule")@ methods, and the homomorphisms in the data can be recovered from @TO("getRestriction")@, @TO("getTransfer")@, and @TO("getConjugation")@.

        Example
            getRestriction M

        Text
            {\bf Pruning:} Any time we might need a nicer, more readable form of a Mackey functor, we can use the @TO2((prune,CpMackeyFunctor),"prune")@ method to simplify the presentation of the underlying/fixed modules.

            {\bf Algebraic constructors:} We provide specific methods for constructing common examples of $C_p$-Mackey functors coming from algebra and representation theory. The @TO2(makeBurnsideMackeyFunctor,"Burnside Mackey functor")@ is a prototypical example -- its underlying module is $\ZZ$ with trivial conjugation action, and its fixed module is the {\em Burnside ring} $A(C_p)$, which is the group completion of the monoid of isomorphism classes of finite $C_p$-sets.

            Another example from algebra are the @TO2(makeRealRepresentationMackeyFunctor,"real")@ and @TO2(makeComplexRepresentationMackeyFunctor,"complex representation")@ Mackey functors. Similarly to the Burnside Mackey functor, their underlying module is $\ZZ$, however their fixed module is the representation ring of $C_p$. Any finite $C_p$-set has an associated permutation representation, which induces what are called the @TO2(realLinearizationMap,"real")@ and @TO2(complexLinearizationMap,"complex linearization maps")@ from the Burnside Mackey functor to the representation Mackey functor.

            {\bf Fixed point and orbit Mackey functors:} If $M$ is a $\ZZ[C_p]$-module, the @TO2(,"fixed point Mackey functor")@ of $M$ has $M$ as its underlying module and the fixed points $M^{C_p}$ as its fixed module. The conjugation action on $M$ is the $C_p$-action, and the transfer sums along the orbits of an element.

        Example
            makeFixedPointMackeyFunctor(2,matrix{{0,1,0},{1,0,0},{0,0,1}})

        Text
            Similarly, given a $\ZZ[C_p]$-module $M$, we can form the @TO2(,"orbit Mackey functor")@, whose underlying module is again $M$ with $C_p$-action yielding conjugation. The fixed point module is now the {\em quotient module} $M/C_p$, transfer is the quotient map, and now {\em restriction} is defined by summing along the orbits.

        Example
            makeOrbitMackeyFunctor(2,matrix{{0,1,0},{1,0,0},{0,0,1}})

        Text
            {\bf Free constructors:} Analogous to how a free module can be constructed on a generator or set of generators, we can construct free Mackey functors. For $C_p$-Mackey functors, there are two modules, which lead to two different ideas of a "free" Mackey functor, namely a free $C_p$-Mackey functor on a generator in the {\em underlying} module, and a free $C_p$-Mackey functor on a generator in the {\em fixed} module. The @TO2(,"free Mackey functor on a single underlying generator")@ can be accessed as follows:

        Example
            makeUnderlyingFreeMackeyFunctor(3)

        Text
            We often call this $\underline{B}$. Trying to construct a free Mackey functor on a single generator in the fixed module, we see that it recovers a similar construction, namely the @TO2(makeBurnsideMackeyFunctor,"Burnside Mackey functor")@, which we often denote by $\underline{A}$.

        Example
            makeFixedFreeMackeyFunctor(5)
            makeBurnsideMackeyFunctor(5)

        Text
            These two Mackey functors $\underline{A}$ and $\underline{B}$ are very special - they are the projective generators of the category $\text{Mack}_G$, and they play an important role in @TO2((resolution,CpMackeyFunctor,ZZ),"constructing resolutions")@.

            {\bf Random constructor:}
            Furthermore we have a {\bf random constructor} which allow us to build a @TO2(makeRandomCpMackeyFunctor,"random Mackey functor")@ over the group $C_p$. To implement this, we recall that we have projective generators $\underline{A}$ and $\underline{B}$, hence any Mackey functor $M$ can be written as a cokernel of some @TO2((map,CpMackeyFunctor, CpMackeyFunctor, Matrix, Matrix),"map")@ of the form

            \[ \underline{A}^k \oplus \underline{B}^\ell \to \underline{A}^n \oplus \underline{B}^m \to M \to 0.\]

            We can specify $k$, $\ell$, $n$, and $m$ if we want, as the following example over $C_7$ shows:

        Example
            makeRandomCpMackeyFunctor(7,{2,2,3,3})

        Text
            If we don't want to specify this data, $n$ and $m$ will be chosen randomly between 1 and 10. To randomly choose between 1 and a higher number, we can use the @TT("GenBound")@ option.

        Example
            makeRandomCpMackeyFunctor(3)
            prune makeRandomCpMackeyFunctor(3,GenBound=>20)
        Text
            {\bf Remark:} What makes this possible is the fact that it is computationally very easy to cook up a random map $\underline{A}^k \oplus \underline{B}^\ell \to \underline{A}^n \oplus \underline{B}^m$ using the universal properties of the functors $\underline{A}$ and $\underline{B}$. Since $\underline{A}$ corepresents the @TO2(getFixedModule,"fixed module")@ functor and $\underline{B}$ corepresents the @TO2(getUnderlyingModule,"underlying module")@ functor, we can determine random maps of the form $\underline{A}^k \oplus \underline{B}^\ell \to M$ by picking a @TO2((random,List,Module),"random list of elements")@ from the fixed and underlying modules of any $M$.

    Description
        Text
            The {\em Burnside Mackey functor} of a group $G$ is defined by sending $G/H$ to the Burnside ring $A(H)$, with transfer and restriction coming from transfer and restriction of finite $G$-sets. When $G$ is a cyclic group of prime order, these maps admit a particularly nice form. The underlying module is given by $\mathbb{Z}$, with trivial conjugation actin=on, while the fixed module is $\mathbb{Z}\{1,t\}$. Restriction is defined as $$\text{res}_e^{C_p} \colon \mathbb{Z}\{1,t\} \to \mathbb{Z}$$ by sending $t\mapsto p$. Transfer is of the form $$\text{tr}_e^{C_p} \colon \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\{1,t\}$$ by sending $x\mapsto xt$.

This means there is a natural isomorphism $$\text{Hom}_{\text{Mack}_{C_p}}\left(\underline{B},M \right) \cong M(C_p/e).$$
        Text
            In components, the underlying module is the free module on the $C_p$-set  $C_p/e=\{1,\gamma,\gamma^2,\ldots,\gamma^{p-1}\}$, with conjugation induced by the $C_p$-action of left multiplication. The fixed module is the module $\ZZ$. Restriction is the map $$\text{res}_e^{C_p} \colon \ZZ \to \ZZ\{1,\gamma,\ldots,\gamma^{p-1}\}$$ by sending $1\mapsto 1+\gamma+\cdots+\gamma^{p-1}$. The transfer is the map $$\text{tr}_e^{C_p} \colon \ZZ\{1,\gamma,\ldots,\gamma^{p-1}\} \to \ZZ$$ by sending $\gamma^i\mapsto 1$ for all $i$.
