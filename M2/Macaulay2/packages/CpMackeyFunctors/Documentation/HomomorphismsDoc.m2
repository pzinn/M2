        N : CpMackeyFunctor

    Outputs
        : MackeyFunctorHomomorphism
            the morphism of Mackey functors which is F at the fixed point level and U at the underlying level.
    Description
        Text
            A morphisms of $C_p$-Mackey functors consists of a group homomorphism on the fixed and underlying levels which commutes with the transfer, restriction, and conjugation morphisms.  This method will throw an error if the morphism is not well defined.
        Example
            map(makeComplexRepresentationMackeyFunctor 3, makeBurnsideMackeyFunctor 3, matrix {{1}}, matrix {{1,1},{0,1},{0,1}})
