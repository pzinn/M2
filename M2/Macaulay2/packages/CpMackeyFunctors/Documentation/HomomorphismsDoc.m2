            The @TO2(Type,"type")@ of a {\em Mackey functor homomorphism} (for definitions, see @TO("background on Mackey functors")@). A Mackey functor homomorphism can be constructed with an implementation of the @TO2((map,CpMackeyFunctor,CpMackeyFunctor,Matrix,Matrix),"map")@ method in this package. Given a Mackey functor homomorphism @TT("f")@, the data for this type can be accessed in the following way:

            @UL {
                (TT "target f", " -- yields the codomain/target of the homomorphism. See ", TO2((target, MackeyFunctorHomomorphism),"target")),
                (TT "source f", " -- yields the domain/source of the homomorphism. See ", TO2((source, MackeyFunctorHomomorphism),"source")),
                (TT "f.UnderlyingMap", " -- yields the induced ", TO2("Macaulay2Doc :: module homomorphisms","homomorphism")," on the ", TO2(CpMackeyFunctor,"underlying modules"),". See ", TO("UnderlyingMap")),
                (TT "f.FixedMap", " -- yields the induced ", TO2("Macaulay2Doc :: module homomorphisms","homomorphism")," on the ", TO2(CpMackeyFunctor,"fixed modules"), ". See ", TO("FixedMap")),
            }@

            ({\bf Warning}: the following method @TO("makeRandomMackeyFunctorHomomorphism")@ takes ({\em source,target}) as input, which follows the @TO("Hom")@ convention rather than the @TO("map")@ convention):
        Example
            M = makeRandomCpMackeyFunctor(2);
            N = makeRandomCpMackeyFunctor(2);
            f = makeRandomMackeyFunctorHomomorphism(M,N)
