        The type of Cp Mackey functors
    Description
        Text
            This documents the @TO2(Type,"type")@ of $C_p$-Mackey functors. A $C_p$-Mackey functor is encoded as a @TO2(HashTable, "hash table")@ with keys through which we can pull various parts of the data.
        Text
            The keys available (internally) in the hash table are as follows, together with their external {\tt get} methods:

            @UL {
                (TT ".PrimeOrder", " yields the ", TO2(ZZ,"order"), " of the cyclic group over which we're working. See ", TO("PrimeOrder")),
                (TT ".Underlying",
                " encodes the ", TO "module", " ",
                TEX"$M(C_p/e)$", ". See ", TO("Underlying")),
                (TT ".Fixed", " encodes the ",TO "module", " ", TEX"$M(C_p/C_p)$",". See ", TO("Fixed")),
                (TT ".Res"," encodes the restriction ", TO2("Macaulay2Doc :: module homomorphisms","homomorphism")," ",
                TEX"$M(C_p/C_p) \\to M(C_p/e)$",". See ", TO("Res")),

                " encodes the transfer ", TO2("Macaulay2Doc :: module homomorphisms","homomorphism")," ",

            {\bf Constructing new Mackey functors:}

            {\bf Operations with Mackey functor types:} One of the first operations to know about is @TO2((prune,CpMackeyFunctor),"pruning")@ a $C_p$-Mackey functor. There is more information at the prune command, but this basically takes the data of a Mackey functor and attempts to simplify it and make it more reader-friendly. Pruning is the only unary operation on $C_p$-Mackey functors that we consider. In terms of binary (and $n$-ary) operations, there are a few, including:

            @UL {
                (TO2("==","equality"), " of two Mackey functors, via ", TT"M==N"),
                ("the ", TO2(boxProduct,"box product"), " of two Mackey functors, via  ", TT "M**N"),
                ("the ", TO2(directSum,"direct sum")," of two Mackey functors, as ", TT"M++N"),
                ("the ", TO2(InternalHom,"internal hom"), " of two Mackey functors")
            }@

        Text
            Builds an instance of the @TO("CpMackeyFunctor")@ type from the data of a prime number and three matrices, encoding restriction, transfer, and conjugation, respectively. The method will verify whether the input data yields a valid Mackey functor.

        Text
            A Mackey functor $M$ defined over $C_p$ is said to be {\em cohomological} if the composite of restriction followed by transfer is identical to multiplication by $p$ as a map from the @TO2(Fixed,"fixed module")@ of $M$ to itself.
