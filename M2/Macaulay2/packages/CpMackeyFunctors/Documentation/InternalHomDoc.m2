        returns the internal hom Mackey functor between two Mackey functors.
    Usage
        InternalHom(N,M)
    Inputs
        M : CpMackeyFunctor
        N : CpMackeyFunctor
    Outputs
        : CpMackeyFunctor
            the internal hom Mackey functor from M to N.
    Description
        Text
            Given any two Mackey functors $M$ and $N$, we can form their {\em internal hom}, which is a Mackey functor which we denote by $\underline{\text{Hom}}(M,N)$. For example:
        Example
            InternalHom(makeRealRepresentationMackeyFunctor 3, makeComplexRepresentationMackeyFunctor 3)
        Text
            The underlying @TO2((Hom, CpMackeyFunctor,CpMackeyFunctor),"group of homomorphisms")@ between any two Mackey functors can be recovered as the @TO2(Fixed,"fixed module")@ key of the internal hom.

        returns the induced map on an internal hom.
    Usage
        InternalHom(F,M)
        InternalHom(M,F)
    Inputs
        M : CpMackeyFunctor
        F : MackeyFunctorHomomorphism
    Outputs
        : MackeyFunctorHomomorphism
            the induced map on internal hom Mackey functors
    Description
        Text
            The internal hom of Mackey functors is functorial in each variable.  This method returns the induced maps.
        Example
            InternalHom(makeRealRepresentationMackeyFunctor(5), complexLinearizationMap(5))
